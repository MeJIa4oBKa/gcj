The module GCJ provides a ramework for making GCJ (Google Code Jam) programs.

The important function is runGCJ, which takes a (parsec) parser, a solver and constructs a
function taking an input filename and an output filename and then reads and parses the input file
and writes solutions to the output file in the standard GCJ output format.
If the output filename is "" (empty string) then the output is written in a test-friendly format to the screen.


The subdirectories contain solutions to GCJ problems from the year indicated by the name of the subdirectory.
